  <h3>Call log</h3>
  <p>After you give us permission to record the call, we will talk to you via voice call. The purpose of collecting call records is to be able to confirm that you are using your mobile phone to install our application and receive our dynamic password verification on the same machine. Specifically, we will verify your device by making a call, and check your call history to see if you have received the call. This makes your credit more reliable and access to faster loan services. We will not monitor, read, store or share any private call data.</p>
  
  <h3>SMS</h3>
  <p>We collect any of your SMS data, but only monitor your messages related to financial transactions.

All contact lists will not be monitored, stored or shared with any third parties.</p>
